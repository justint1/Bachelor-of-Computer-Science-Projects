Instruction to execute CSCI 4144 group project, group 27:
1. Navigate to folder with main.py and parkinsons.csv
2. Enter command "python main.py" to execute program
3. Enter command "vim results.txt" to view results
NOTE: Results differ from those in the report as each accuracy is suppose to be computed 100 times and the average and standard deviation are computed from those 100 values.
I computed the correct values over 100 times for the tables in the project report but the programs runtime was over 5 minutes locally.
For times sake, I reduced that number to 3 times for the current program so you can still see it running, but results are slightly less accurate.
